### Tech

The app is powered by native GraphQL database Slash GraphQL from Dgraph Labs. GraphQL was first choice for the project based on initial features and UI components design, as the App was developed GraphQL features came in handy.

The app is built with ReactNative so that app can be available to both iOS and Android users at earliest. The updated developer experience and power of React made it easy to develop and ship fast.

Apollo Client is used to make graphQL requests. Apollo Client 3.0 provided smooth developer experience. Apollo hooks made things easy during development.

Auth0 is identity provider and is used to protect GraphQL user endpoint and user data.
